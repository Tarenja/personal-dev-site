Personal Developer Site

This is a preliminary version of my personal portfolio site as a developer. It is very basic at the moment, 
and will likely receive a major overhaul once I truly decide how I want to represent myself.

As this was on a deadline for a class assignment, I kept it relatively simple and clean.
